## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

-   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/J-shw/Menstrudel/issues).
-   If you're unable to find an open issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/J-shw/Menstrudel/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include a title, a clear description, and as much relevant information as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

-   Open a new issue to discuss your idea.
-   Clearly describe the feature and why it would be useful.

### Translations

All app translations are managed through Crowdin. We welcome contributions, whether you're suggesting a new language or improving existing translations!

**[Go to the Menstrudel Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/menstrudel)**

* **To Add a New Language:** Please request the new language through the Crowdin project.
* **To Add Translations:** Once you join the project, you can contribute by translating any untranslated text for the languages you speak.

You do not need to edit any `.arb` or `.dart` files in this repository. All translation changes will be synced from Crowdin by the maintainers.

For more details please see the [translation docs](docs/translation/README.md)

## Branching Model

-   `dev` is the default branch. All new development should be merged here.
-   `main` is considered live, production-ready code.
