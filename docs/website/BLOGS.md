## Create a New Post

### 1. Create a New File

All blog posts are located in the `_posts` folder. To create a new post, add a new file to this directory.

The filename **must** follow this specific format:

`YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`

-   **YYYY-MM-DD:** The full date of publication.
-   **your-post-title:** A short, descriptive title with words separated by hyphens.

**Example:** `2025-09-14-new-feature-announcement.md`

### 2. Add the Front Matter

At the very top of your new file, copy and paste the following block of text. This is the "Front Matter" and it tells Jekyll important information about the post.

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Amazing Post Title Goes Here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
categories: [category1, category2]
image: /assets/images/blog/2025-09-14-new-feature-announcement/your-featured-image.jpg
author: "Jane Doe"
---
```

-   **title:** The full title of the post that will be displayed on the page. Keep it inside the quotation marks.
-   **date:** The exact date and time of publication.
-   **categories:** A list of categories for the post. This is optional but useful for organization. Common categories for this site are `release notes` and `announcements`.
-   **image:** This is the main "featured image" for the post. Its path is used to tell Google which image to show in search results. Place your image in the `/assets/images/blog/` folder under a new folder named after your post file (`2025-09-14-new-feature-announcement`) and update the path here. The path must start with a /.
-   **author:** _(Optional)_ This is the name of the person who wrote the post. If you delete this entire line, the post will automatically be authored by the organisation, "Menstrudel". If you are writing as an individual add your name here.

### 3. Write Your Content

Below the Front Matter, you can write your post using standard Markdown.

```markdown
### This is a Subheading

![This is an image](/assets/images/blog/image.png) <!-- Make sure to put your image in the `assets/images/blog` folder -->


This is a regular paragraph. You can add lists, links, and other formatting.

-   Item 1
-   Item 2
```

### 4. Publish the Post

Once you have saved your file, commit the changes and push them to your own branch using the scheme `feature/web/my-blog-example`. Once ready, make a pull request to the `dev` branch on GitHub. The website will automatically update with your new post once accepted.
